# my awesome title 4.1

<img src="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/static/base/img/logo-160.png" alt="MacDown logo" />

Hello there! I’m <strong>MacDown</strong>, the open source Markdown editor for OS X.

Let me introduce myself.

<h2>Markdown and I</h2>

<strong>Markdown</strong> is a plain text formatting syntax created by John Gruber, aiming to provide a easy-to-read and feasible markup. The original Markdown syntax specification can be found <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">here</a>.

<strong>MacDown</strong> is created as a simple-to-use editor for Markdown documents. I render your Markdown contents real-time into HTML, and display them in a preview panel.

<img src="http://d.pr/i/10UGP+" alt="MacDown Screenshot" />

I support all the original Markdown syntaxes. But I can do so much more! Various popular but non-standard syntaxes can be turned on/off from the <a href="#markdown-pane"><strong>Markdown</strong> preference pane</a>.

You can specify extra HTML rendering options through the <a href="#rendering-pane"><strong>Rendering</strong> preference pane</a>.

You can customize the editor window to you liking in the <a href="#editor-pane"><strong>Editor</strong> preferences pane</a>:

You can configure various application (that's me!) behaviors in the <a href="#general-pane"><strong>General</strong> preference pane</a>.

<h2>The Basics</h2>

Before I tell you about all the extra syntaxes and capabilities I have, I'll introduce you to the basics of standard markdown. If you already know markdown, and want to jump straight to learning about the fancier things I can do, I suggest you skip to the <a href="#markdown-pane"><strong>Markdown</strong> preference pane</a>. Lets jump right in.

<h3>Line Breaks</h3>

To force a line break, put two spaces and a newline (return) at the end of the line.

These lines
won't break

These lines
will break

<h3>Strong and Emphasize</h3>

<strong>Strong</strong>: <code>**Strong**</code> or <code>__Strong__</code> (Command-B)
<em>Emphasize</em>: <code>*Emphasize*</code> or <code>_Emphasize_</code><sup id="fnref-6-emphasize"><a href="#fn-6-emphasize" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (Command-I)

<h3>Headers (like this one!)</h3>

<h1>Header 1</h1>

<h2>Header 2</h2>

or

<h1>Header 1</h1>

<h2>Header 2</h2>

<h3>Header 3</h3>

<h4>Header 4</h4>

<h5>Header 5</h5>

<h6>Header 6</h6>

<h3>Links and Email</h3>

<h4>Inline</h4>

Just put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable:
``

Same thing with urls:
<code></code>

Perhaps you want to some link text like this: <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com" title="Title">Macdown Website</a>
<code>[Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")</code> (The title is optional)

<h4>Reference style</h4>

Sometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together.

Make <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com" title="Title">a link</a> <code>[a link][arbitrary_id]</code> then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:
<code>[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"</code>

If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com">like this</a> <code>[like this][]</code>, then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:
<code>[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com</code>

<h3>Images</h3>

<h4>Inline</h4>

<code>![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")</code>

<h4>Reference style</h4>

<code>![Alt Image Text][image-id]</code>
on it's own line elsewhere:
<code>[image-id]: path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title"</code>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)</li>
<li>Unordered lists start each item with a <code>*</code></li>
<li><code>-</code> works too</li>
<li>Indent a level to make a nested list</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Ordered lists are supported.</li>
<li>Start each item (number-period-space) like <code>1.</code></li>
<li>It doesn't matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially</li>
<li>So you might want to start each line with <code>1.</code> and let me sort it out</li>
</ol>

Here is the code:

<pre><code>* Lists must be preceded by a blank line (or block element)
* Unordered lists start each item with a `*`
- `-` works too
* Indent a level to make a nested list
1. Ordered lists are supported.
2. Start each item (number-period-space) like `1. `
42. It doesn't matter what number you use, I will render them sequentially
1. So you might want to start each line with `1.` and let me sort it out
</code></pre>

<h3>Block Quote</h3>

<blockquote>
  Angle brackets <code>&amp;gt;</code> are used for block quotes.
  Technically not every line needs to start with a <code>&amp;gt;</code> as long as
  there are no empty lines between paragraphs.
  Looks kinda ugly though.
  &gt; Block quotes can be nested.
  &gt; &gt; Multiple Levels
  
  Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
  
  <ul>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li><a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com" title="Title">Links</a></li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

Here is the code:

<pre><code>&gt; Angle brackets `&amp;gt;` are used for block quotes.
Technically not every line needs to start with a `&amp;gt;` as long as
there are no empty lines between paragraphs.
&gt; Looks kinda ugly though.
&gt; &amp;gt; Block quotes can be nested.
&gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Multiple Levels
&gt;
&gt; Most markdown syntaxes work inside block quotes.
&gt;
&gt; * Lists
&gt; * [Links][arbitrary_id]
&gt; * Etc.
</code></pre>

<h3>Inline Code</h3>

<code>Inline code</code> is indicated by surrounding it with backticks:
<code>`Inline code`</code>

If your <code>code has `backticks`</code> that need to be displayed, you can use double backticks:
<code>``Code with `backticks` ``</code> (mind the spaces preceding the final set of backticks)

<h3>Block Code</h3>

If you indent at least four spaces or one tab, I'll display a code block.

print('This is a code block')
print('The block must be preceded by a blank line')
print('Then indent at least 4 spaces or 1 tab')
print('Nesting does nothing. Your code is displayed Literally')

I also know how to do something called <a href="#fenced-code-block">Fenced Code Blocks</a> which I will tell you about later.

<h3>Horizontal Rules</h3>

If you type three asterisks <code>***</code> or three dashes <code>---</code> on a line, I'll display a horizontal rule:

<hr />

<h2><a name="markdown-pane"></a>The Markdown Preference Pane</h2>

This is where I keep all preferences related to how I parse markdown into html.
<img src="http://d.pr/i/RQEi+" alt="Markdown preferences pane" />

<h3>Document Formatting</h3>

The <strong><em>Smartypants</em></strong> extension automatically transforms straight quotes (<code>"</code> and <code>'</code>) in your text into typographer’s quotes (<code>“</code>, <code>”</code>, <code>‘</code>, and <code>’</code>) according to the context. Very useful if you’re a typography freak like I am. Quote and Smartypants are syntactically incompatible. If both are enabled, Quote takes precedence.

<h3>Block Formatting</h3>

<h4>Table</h4>

This is a table:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>First Header</th>
  <th>Second Header</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Content Cell</td>
  <td>Content Cell</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Content Cell</td>
  <td>Content Cell</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can align cell contents with syntax like this:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Left Aligned</th>
  <th align="center">Center Aligned</th>
  <th align="right">Right Aligned</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">col 3 is</td>
  <td align="center">some wordy text</td>
  <td align="right">$1600</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">col 2 is</td>
  <td align="center">centered</td>
  <td align="right">$12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">zebra stripes</td>
  <td align="center">are neat</td>
  <td align="right">$1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The left- and right-most pipes (<code>|</code>) are only aesthetic, and can be omitted. The spaces don’t matter, either. Alignment depends solely on <code>:</code> marks.

<h4><a name="fenced-code-block"></a>Fenced Code Block</h4>

This is a fenced code block:

<pre><code>print('Hello world!')
</code></pre>

You can also use waves (<code>~</code>) instead of back ticks (<code>`</code>):

<pre><code>print('Hello world!')
</code></pre>

You can add an optional language ID at the end of the first line. The language ID will only be used to highlight the code inside if you tick the <strong><em>Enable highlighting in code blocks</em></strong> option. This is what happens if you enable it:

<img src="http://d.pr/i/9HM6+" alt="Syntax highlighting example" />

I support many popular languages as well as some generic syntax descriptions that can be used if your language of choice is not supported. See <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/features/">relevant sections on the official site</a> for a full list of supported syntaxes.

<h3>Inline Formatting</h3>

The following is a list of optional inline markups supported:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Option name</th>
  <th>Markup</th>
  <th>Result if enabled</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Intra-word emphasis</td>
  <td>So A<em>maz</em>ing</td>
  <td>So A<em>maz</em>ing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Strikethrough</td>
  <td>~~Much wow~~</td>
  <td><del>Much wow</del></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Underline <sup id="fnref-6-under"><a href="#fn-6-under" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></td>
  <td><em>So doge</em></td>
  <td><u>So doge</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Quote <sup id="fnref-6-quote"><a href="#fn-6-quote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></td>
  <td>"Such editor"</td>
  <td><q>Such editor</q></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Highlight</td>
  <td>==So good==</td>
  <td><mark>So good</mark></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Superscript</td>
  <td>hoge^(fuga)</td>
  <td>hoge<sup>fuga</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Autolink</td>
  <td>http://t.co</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Footnotes</td>
  <td><sup id="fnref-6-4"><a href="#fn-6-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref2:6-4"><a href="#fn-6-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>:</td>
  <td><sup id="fnref3:6-4"><a href="#fn-6-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> and footnote 4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2><a name="rendering-pane"></a>The Rendering Preference Pane</h2>

This is where I keep preferences relating to how I render and style the parsed markdown in the preview window.
<img src="http://d.pr/i/rT4d+" alt="Rendering preferences pane" />

<h3>CSS</h3>

You can choose different css files for me to use to render your html. You can even customize or add your own custom css files.

<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>

You have already seen how I can syntax highlight your fenced code blocks. See the <a href="#fenced-code-block">Fenced Code Block</a> section if you haven’t! You can also choose different themes for syntax highlighting.

<h3>TeX-like Math Syntax</h3>

I can also render TeX-like math syntaxes, if you allow me to.<sup id="fnref-6-math"><a href="#fn-6-math" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> I can do inline math like this: ( 1 + 1 ) or this (in MathML): 1+1, and block math:

[
A^T_S = B
]

or (in MathML)

<h1>A S T</h1>

B

<h3>Task List Syntax</h3>

<ol>
<li>[x] I can render checkbox list syntax</li>
</ol>

* [x] I support nesting
* [x] I support ordered <em>and</em> unordered lists
2. [ ] I don't support clicking checkboxes directly in the html window

<h3>Jekyll front-matter</h3>

If you like, I can display Jekyll front-matter in a nice table. Just make sure you put the front-matter at the very beginning of the file, and fence it with <code>---</code>. For example:

<pre><code>---
title: "Macdown is my friend"
date: 2014-06-06 20:00:00
---
</code></pre>

<h3>Render newline literally</h3>

Normally I require you to put two spaces and a newline (aka return) at the end of a line in order to create a line break. If you like, I can render a newline any time you end a line with a newline. However, if you enable this, markdown that looks lovely when I render it might look pretty funky when you let some <em>other</em> program render it.

<h2><a name="general-pane"></a>The General Preferences Pane</h2>

This is where I keep preferences related to application behavior.
<img src="http://d.pr/i/rvwu+" alt="General preferences pane" />

The General Preferences Pane allows you to tell me how you want me to behave. For example, do you want me to make sure there is a document open when I launch? You can also tell me if I should constantly update the preview window as you type, or wait for you to hit <code>command-R</code> instead. Maybe you prefer your editor window on the right? Or to see the word-count as you type. This is also the place to tell me if you are interested in pre-releases of me, or just want to stick to better-tested official releases.

<h2><a name="editor-pane"></a>The Editor Preference Pane</h2>

This is where I keep preferences related to the behavior and styling of the editing window.
<img src="http://d.pr/i/6OL5+" alt="Editor preferences pane" />

<h3>Styling</h3>

My editor provides syntax highlighting. You can edit the base font and the coloring/sizing theme. I provided some default themes (courtesy of <a href="http://mouapp.com">Mou</a>’s creator, Chen Luo) if you don’t know where to start.

You can also edit, or even add new themes if you want to! Just click the <strong><em>Reveal</em></strong> button, and start moving things around. Remember to use the correct file extension (<code>.styles</code>), though. I’m picky about that.

I offer auto-completion and other functions to ease your editing experience. If you don’t like it, however, you can turn them off.

<h2>Hack On</h2>

That’s about it. Thanks for listening. I’ll be quiet from now on (unless there’s an update about the app—I’ll remind you for that!).

Happy writing!
