# PRESTASHOP FIRST FILE TITLE

## Preamble
My custom prestashop documentation....

## Objective
This integration is a standalone application software that will, once set up, handle cash-out operations. This is done by automatically retrieving the payment orders from Mirakl and sending them to HiPay for withdrawal both to the merchants' and the marketplace operator's bank accounts.
