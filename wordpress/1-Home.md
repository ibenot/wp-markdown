# HiPay cash-out integration for Mirakl

## Preamble
awesome dynamic documentation from github

## Objective
This integration is a standalone application software that will, once set up, handle cash-out operations. This is done by automatically retrieving the payment orders from Mirakl and sending them to HiPay for withdrawal both to the merchants' and the marketplace operator's bank accounts.
